# What is it that you are investigating/exploring/analyzing (provide sufficient background information)?
  In the following project, I have to do the analysis of data and for which I have chosen the topic of Financial Sector. The main reason for chosing this topic is its direct relation of it to the Foreign Direct Investment which helps to increase employment opportunities, technology transfer , development and strengthening of our economy. Here I would like to discuss about the factors ie:- imports and exports of the country which plays a key role in bringing Foreign Direct Investment. In this I would be showing you the trends, similarities/differences ie:- comparision between countries.

# Why is it important to you and/or to others?
Financial sector topic seems important to me because it is directly or indirectly related to the development of our country. It helps in developing economies and emerging markets where companies need funding and expertise to improve and expand their international sales, which would be helping in increasing jobs and wages. When the financial sector is strong, it provides the the free flow of capital, liquidity in the marketplace and also companies in the industry able to take risks.

# What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?
Some of the questions or doubts which I would like to clear are:
1. Is it necessary that if a country has good FDI than it will have large amount of balance(financially stable)?
2. Are trade in services fully related to the development or export/import?
3. What are the total exports and imports of the country?
4. What are the debts certain countries are holding?
5. What would be the trade in services(% of GDP) of different countries.

# Where do you get the data to help answer your questions?
I got these datasets from World Developments Explorer(WDX). From their we can get different types of datasets depending upon our interest to explore along with there indicators and charts for comparision.

# What process/step you use to analyze the situation/issue?
I used different types of charts for comparision, similarities or for differentiating between the countries like bubble chart, scatter plots(2-D scatter chart/ bubble chart) and line chart.

# Goods export and import across different countries from 2010-2018![newplot (5)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78184393/113483062-30017b80-94bf-11eb-9f90-46b2afa301b8.png)

Here I am displaying 2 bubble charts with diiferent years 2010 and 2017 for comparision of import and export of goods and FDI for countries like Australia,United States, China, Germany, and India.

In 2010, China has the highest exports and second in the imports, while United States  has the highest imports, with the rest of the world like India, Australia with no change. Whereas in 2017 China overtakes germany in Foreign Direct Investment.
Overall China and United States are top countries in export, import and FDI.

# What is it that you are investigating/exploring/analyzing (provide sufficient background information)?
  In the following project, I have to do the analysis of data and for which I have chosen the topic of Financial Sector. The main reason for chosing this topic is its direct relation of it to the Foreign Direct Investment which helps to increase employment opportunities, technology transfer , development and strengthening of our economy. Here I would like to discuss about the factors ie:- imports and exports of the country which plays a key role in bringing Foreign Direct Investment. In this I would be showing you the trends, similarities/differences ie:- comparision between countries.

# Why is it important to you and/or to others?
Financial sector topic seems important to me because it is directly or indirectly related to the development of our country. It helps in developing economies and emerging markets where companies need funding and expertise to improve and expand their international sales, which would be helping in increasing jobs and wages. When the financial sector is strong, it provides the the free flow of capital, liquidity in the marketplace and also companies in the industry able to take risks.

# What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?
Some of the questions or doubts which I would like to clear are:
1. Is it necessary that if a country has good FDI than it will have large amount of balance(financially stable)?
2. Are trade in services fully related to the development or export/import?
3. What are the total exports and imports of the country?
4. What are the debts certain countries are holding?
5. What would be the trade in services(% of GDP) of different countries.

# Where do you get the data to help answer your questions?
I got these datasets from World Developments Explorer(WDX). From their we can get different types of datasets depending upon our interest to explore along with there indicators and charts for comparision.

# What process/step you use to analyze the situation/issue?
I used different types of charts for comparision, similarities or for differentiating between the countries like bubble chart, scatter plots(2-D scatter chart/ bubble chart) and line chart.

# Goods export and import across different countries from 2010-2018![newplot (5)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78184393/113483062-30017b80-94bf-11eb-9f90-46b2afa301b8.png)

Here I am displaying 2 bubble charts with diiferent years 2010 and 2017 for comparision of import and export of goods and FDI for countries like Australia,United States, China, Germany, and India.

In 2010, China has the highest exports and second in the imports, while United States  has the highest imports, with the rest of the world like India, Australia with no change. Whereas in 2017 China overtakes germany in Foreign Direct Investment.
Overall China and United States are top countries in export, import and FDI.

# Account balance of different countries from 2010-2018

Here, Bar Graph has been used to compare account balance in five different countries: India, China, Germany , Australia and United States.
 
In the first bar graph we can see that in 2010 China has highest account balance followed by Germany and rest countries account balance are going in negative due to a lot of debts. By 2018 Germany is leading in account balance followed by China and no difference in United States balance which was still going negative.

Overall China and Germany are stable which means has no debts other countries among which United States has the lowest account balance which is in negative. This clearly shows having a good FDI or export, import report does not means it has a good financial status.

# Trade in services of different countries from 2010-2018
![newplot (11)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78184393/113485883-8e355b00-94cd-11eb-8516-d59f9ee8fd2e.png)
Here 2D Scatter plot is used to show the trade in services versus there account balance. In this we will see Germany at first place having good account balance along with high trade in services. Though China is behind United States in trade in services but it has large amount of account balance where United States is lacking very mmuch. India is at second position in trade followed by Australia.

# Foreign Direct Investment of countries from 2010-2018
![newplot (10)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78184393/113485416-fa628f80-94ca-11eb-9316-a9c6e5bb6dbc.png)
 Line Graph is used to show the Foreign Direct Investment of 5 countries that are :- India , China, United States, Germany and Australia. 
After leading in this field from a decade, United States saw a downfall in 2018 in there Foreign Direct Investment. And as we can see China and Germany at a constant pace followed by India and Australia. Showing this graph I wanted to take your attention to the fact that having good Foreign Direct Investment does not means it will be having good account balance also ie:- despite having good FDI , United states has a lot of debt which means negatiuve account balance.
